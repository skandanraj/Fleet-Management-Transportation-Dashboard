# 🚛 Fleet Management Transportation & Logistics Dashboard (Excel)

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project analyzes fleet operations and transportation logistics data to evaluate trip performance, operational expenses, wage distribution, and cargo movement efficiency.

The objective was to design a KPI-driven interactive dashboard in Microsoft Excel that enables logistics managers to monitor fleet utilization, control expenses, and optimize trip planning decisions.

## 📁 Project Structure

The Excel workbook is organized into the following sheets:

1. **Raw Data Sheet**
   - Contains original trip-level operational data.
   - Includes trip dates, drivers, trucks, routes, cargo types, distance, wages, salary, and hired transportation details.

2. **Table for Schedule Sheet**
   - Cleaned and structured dataset prepared in table format.
   - Used for pivot table and KPI generation.

3. **KPI Sheet**
   - Multiple pivot tables created to calculate operational and financial metrics.

4. **Dashboard – Overview**
   - Executive-level summary of fleet performance.
   - Expense tracking, wage analysis, trip classification, cargo distribution, and distance metrics.

5. **Dashboard – Trip Schedule**
   - Detailed trip schedule with driver allocation and route tracking.
   - Interactive filtering by month and driver.
